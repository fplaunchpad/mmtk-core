//! UP-trace mode: single-tracer plain-operation fast paths.
//!
//! When EXACTLY ONE GC thread traces objects in a fully stopped world with no
//! concurrent marking, every synchronization primitive on the trace hot path
//! is redundant: there is no second thread to race, exclude, or publish to
//! before the pause-ending barrier. The OCaml binding measured 5.7 locked
//! RMW operations per copied object (forwarding claim CAS + SeqCst stores +
//! mark/unlog metadata ops), ~170-230 cycles/object of the 415-vs-80
//! cycles/object gap against stock OCaml's domain-private minor collector
//! (SHAPE.md 2026-08-10).
//!
//! The flag is per MMTk instance (`MMTK::set_up_trace`), set by the VM binding
//! at stop-the-world begin when it can prove the conditions (worker count == 1,
//! mutators quiesced, no concurrent marking window in flight) and cleared
//! before any mutator resumes; the pause-ending lock/unlock provides the
//! publication barrier for the plain writes. Off by default; all paths keep
//! their atomic behaviour unless the binding opts in per pause. LXR/RC paths
//! never consult this flag.
//!
//! Hot paths read a thread-local mirror (`up()`), refreshed by each GC worker
//! before every work packet, rather than a process-global: the soundness
//! argument is per tracer, so the state is per tracer. A process-wide bit
//! would leak one instance's single-worker mode into the workers of another
//! instance collecting concurrently (MMTk permits independent instances),
//! switching their metadata operations to the non-atomic paths.
